Inside of notes.txt, write answers to the following:
a. Your (and your partner’s) name
b. On a scale of 1-10, where 10 is extremely hard and 1 is
extremely easy, how difficult was this lab for you?
c. Estimate how many hours you worked on the lab.
d. Estimate how many hours your partner worked on the lab. (If you
have one.)
e. Given what you know about (1) your output, (2) the
circumstances you were under in your life during this period, (3)
how hard you worked for this lab, and (4) how much your partner
worked on this lab, what grade would you award to
yourself?
f. Is there anything special I should know while testing and reading
your code? (e.g. “such and such crashes my code, but if you skip
past these tests, you can resume here and it should work fine.”
or “such-and-such is not as organized as I would like, but I am
very proud of my code on this other group of functions over
here!” or “This particular test case does run correctly, but it
takes about 3 minutes to complete on my computer.”)
