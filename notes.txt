a. Ella Marmol & Anagha Ajesh

b. For me, the lab was a 6 to 7 out of 10 in terms of difficulty. 

c. I think I worked about 5 to 6 hours on this lab, excluding class time. 

d. Anagha and I did pair programming, and we worked together on my laptop for this (in which I would then push our code onto GitHub). I would say she spent the same amount of time as I did, maybe an hour or two less since it was my laptop we were working on.

e. I would award myself about a 93 on this lab. This was assigned during a very busy time in BCA, especially for juniors, and I think Anagha and I were able to complete a well-functioning lab. Taking into account the work Anagha and I put into this lab outside of class, I think an A (93%) is a grade I would award myself.

f. All of the tests from the Scoring Sheet execute the correct sample output.
